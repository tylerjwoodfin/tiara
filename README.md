## Keybindings in `tiara`

I tried making the keybindings as intuitive and expected as possible, and for the most part they are. For example, generally `c` creates an entity, `d` deletes, `k` moves up, `j` moves down, etc...

## Window Manager Integration

If you want to launch it sort of like an application you can make a keybinding to launch your terminal with `tiara` running instead of the shell. For example, here is how I do it with `st` and `dwm`.

```bash
st -e sh -c tiara
```

```c
static Key keys[] = {
    /* modifier                                key                        function        argument */
    ....
    { (Mod4Mask|Mod1Mask),                     XK_t,                      spawn,          SHCMD("st -e sh -c tiara") },
    ....
};
```
